Although I was born in Madrid, I do not consider myself a city person. My family comes from Extremadura (western Spain), where I've spent many good times surrounded by sheep.

Ever since I was a little kid, curioisy has been the main driver of all my naughty deeds. Nature has always fascinated me. However, although I remember spending countless summer nights with my family on the front door of my gradparents house (what we call "tomar el fresco"), 
laying on the floor while at the skies, my passion for astronomy took quite a few years to blossom.
