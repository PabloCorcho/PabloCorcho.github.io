### Â¡Hola! I am an early career researcher with a strong passion for the Universe and everything that lives in it.

My **research** is mainly focused on **extragalactic astrophysics**. I study **star formation** in galaxies, and the **physical processes** that drive the **build-up** of their **stellar content**. Among my favourite subjects, I enjoy
studying what is referred to as galaxy **quenching**: the abrupt **cessation of star formation** due to the action of some mechanisms that prevent the conversion of gas into stars.

> Constraining the physics behing galaxy **quenching is key** for understanding the **formation of galaxies** across the **history of the Universe**.

To answer these questions, I work with both **ground-** and **space-based telescopes** across **multiple regimes** of the electromagnetic **spectrum**.

I am a member of the [Euclid](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid) mission. In particular, I perform the quality control of the ground-based data that is used to complement the observations from space.


However, my favourite observing technique is the so-called **Integral Field Spectroscopy** (IFS), which uses state-of-the-art spectrographs fed by one or seveal Integral Field Units (IFUs), providing both spatial and spectroscopic information simultaneously. I am a member of several **on-going surveys** whose aim is to gain unprecedented insights about the evolution galaxies through the use of cutting-edge instrumentation:

- [WEAVE](https://weave-project.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WEAVE/overview).
- [Hector](https://hector.survey.org.au)

I am the main **developer** of [PyKOALA](https://pykoala.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), a python library for IFS data reduction and the main tool for the [KOALA](https://aat.anu.edu.au/science/instruments/current/koala/overview) instrument.
