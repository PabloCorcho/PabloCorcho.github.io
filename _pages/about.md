### Â¡Hola! I'm an early-career researcher driven by a deep passion for the Universe and all forms of life within it.

My **research** focuses on **extragalactic astrophysics**. I study **star formation** in galaxies and the **physical mechanisms** that drive the **build-up of their stellar content**.

Among the topics I find most fascinating, I enjoy studying **galaxy quenching** -- the sudden **cessation of star formation** caused by mechanisms that prevent gas from turning into stars.

> Understanding the **physics behind galaxy quenching** is essential for unraveling the story of **galaxy formation** across the history of the Universe.

To explore these questions, I use data from both **ground-based** and **space-based telescopes**, working across **multiple wavelength regimes** of the electromagnetic spectrum.

I am a member of the [Euclid](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid) mission, a space telescope launched by the **European Space Agency**. My role involves **quality control** of ground-based data, which complements the observations made from space.

My favourite observing technique is **Integral Field Spectroscopy** (IFS). This powerful method uses spectrographs fed by Integral Field Units (IFUs) to capture both **spatial and spectral information** simultaneously -- allowing us to dissect galaxies in unprecedented detail.

I am involved in several ongoing IFS surveys designed to provide new insights into galaxy evolution using cutting-edge technology:

- [WEAVE](https://weave-project.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WEAVE/overview)
- [Hector](https://hector.survey.org.au)

I am the main **developer** of [PyKOALA](https://pykoala.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), a python library for IFS data reduction. PyKOALA is the primary tool used for data from the [KOALA](https://aat.anu.edu.au/science/instruments/current/koala/overview) instrument on the Anglo-Australian Telescope.
